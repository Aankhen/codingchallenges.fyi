# Coding Challenges

This is where I try the challenges from [codingchallenges.fyi](https://codingchallenges.fyi/). Rust is making this almost too easy so far, but given how much the challenges seem to vary in scope, it seems unlikely that I’ll be finishing all of them here.

Since I already spend more time than is healthy building and refining CLIs for various tools, I’ll probably skip that part of the challenges. The rest of it is usually more interesting.

**Expect much force-pushing to `main`, as befits a repository I’m just messing around in.**
